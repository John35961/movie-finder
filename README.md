# Movie Finder

Movie Finder allows you to add comments to a list of films, while also addding to bookmark lists. That application was among the very first Rails projects coded during [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon) bootcamp, which I attented in spring 2022. The app's logic is very limited, but it was a good entry point to get to know more on routing, models and user uploads in Rails.
